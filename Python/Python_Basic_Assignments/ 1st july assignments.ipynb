    "### 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "**Ans:** The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that promotes the organization of code in a modular, reusable, and understandable manner. OOP aims to structure programs around objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key goals of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **``Modularity``**: OOP encourages the decomposition of complex systems into smaller, self-contained modules called objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **``Encapsulation:``** OOP supports encapsulation by hiding the internal details and complexities of an object from other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **``Abstraction:``** OOP emphasizes abstraction by focusing on the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object while hiding irrelevant details. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **``Inheritance:``** OOP provides inheritance as a mechanism for creating new classes based on existing classes. Inheritance allows the reuse of common attributes and behaviors defined in a base (parent) class, reducing code duplication and promoting code organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **``Polymorphism:``** OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. "

    "### 2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "**Ans:** An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. Python is an object-oriented programming language that stresses objects i.e. it mainly emphasizes functions. Python Objects are basically an encapsulation of data variables and methods acting on that data into a single entity."

    "### 3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "**Ans:** A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state."

    "**Ans:** In object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm used in languages like Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class, and they can have attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Attributes are variables that hold data associated with an object. They define the characteristics or properties of the object. \n",

    "Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that can perform actions or operations on the object's attributes or alter the object's state. They define the behavior of the object"

    "**Ans:** In Python, both class variables and instance variables are used to store data within a class. However, they have different scopes and purposes within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**``Class Variables:``**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods.\n",
    "2. They are associated with the class itself, not with individual instances of the class.\n",
    "3. They are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "4. If a class variable is modified, the change is reflected in all instances of the class.\n",
    "5. Class variables are accessed using the class name."

It is a convention in Python programming to name this parameter as self, although you could technically use any other name. The purpose of the self parameter is to give methods access to the attributes and other methods of the instance it belongs to."
