    "### 1. What is the role of try and exception block?\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, the \"**try**\" and \"**except**\" blocks are used for error handling and exception handling. They allow you to handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code, ensuring that your program doesn't abruptly terminate but gracefully handles the error and continues execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using try and except blocks helps you handle exceptions gracefully, provide appropriate error messages, and control the flow of your program even in the presence of errors or unexpected situations. "

    "\n",
    "1. **``EOFError``**: This error is raised when the built-in input() function hits an end-of-file condition. It occurs when there is an attempt to read input from the user, but no more data is available, such as when the user cancels input (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **``FloatingPointError``**: This error is raised when a floating-point operation fails. It typically occurs when there is an error in mathematical calculations involving floating-point numbers, such as division by zero or an invalid mathematical operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **``IndexError``**: This error is raised when a sequence (such as a list or a string) is accessed using an invalid index. It occurs when you try to access an index that is outside the range of valid indices for the given sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **``MemoryError``**: This error is raised when an operation fails due to insufficient memory. It occurs when the Python interpreter cannot allocate enough memory to complete the requested operation, such as creating a new object or expanding a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **``OverflowError``**: This error is raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented within the numeric type. It occurs when a calculation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored by the given numeric type.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **``TabError``**: This error is raised when inconsistent or incorrect indentation using tabs and spaces is detected in Python code. It occurs when the interpreter encounters an indentation-related issue, such as mixing tabs and spaces or using an incorrect number of indentation spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **``ValueError``**: The Python ValueError is raised when the wrong value is assigned to an object. This can happen if the value is invalid for a given operation, or if the value does not exist. For example, if a negative integer is passed to a square root operation, a ValueError is raised."
